=========
This code shows an (partial) example of how to use ExtJS 5.0 GridPanel with a BufferedStore backed by a jsonp proxy.

The application requires a MySQL DB. It can be used with postgres or mssql as well, but the example is setup for MySQL.

It is a PHP application so LAMP or MAMP stack is an additional requirement.
